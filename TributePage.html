              "For several days and nights, i have found it so difficult to rest or sleep,
              reminiscing on your endless sacrifices and rare heart towards God and mankind. <br>
              From childhood to my age, i never heard your voice raised in quarrels or disagreements. <br>
              you never asked for your rights but you got them chasing after ytou. <br>
              You would be hungry to feed everyone around you. <br>
              I have been busy studying your version of Christianity and ways of life."
              <br>
              <br>
              My greatest prayer since you left was for God to grant my son, Keneya, your kind of human specie as a wife.
              <br>
              <br>
              Mama, Mom, the wound is deep but i would be fine knowing where you are right now.
              Today, I will fare you last BYE while I try to adopt your version of Christianity.
              <br>
              <br>
              Your words will ever remain fresh... Forever!
